The likely association of TXS0506+056 and of several other blazars with IceCube astrophysical neutrinos (e.g. Giommi et al. 2020,
arXiv:2001.09355 and references therein) is the observational basis of maturing evidence that blazars may be the counterparts of
at least a fraction of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. In an effort to build a public database of quasi-simultaneous
multi-messenger observations of possible neutrino counterparts we propose to make short XRT ToO observations of the blazars inside
or close to the uncertainty area of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos shortly after the IceCube (or other neutrino observatory)
detection.
Since the uncertainty in the arrival direction of astrophysical neutrinos is often very large compared to the field of view of
XRT, this approach is complementary to the much more expensive tiling coverage of the IceCube error region, which in most cases
cannot be completely covered.

A relatively short (e.g. 3Ks) observation of each blazar in the error region of IC200615A  would be sufficient to determine the X-ray
flux level and the spectral slope, therefore allowing the detection of a possible on-going flare or of an unusual spectral shape,
which could turn out to be crucial information for the possible association of the blazar with the neutrino.

An automatic analysis carried out immediately after the arrival of IC200615A with the VOU-Blazars tool
(Chang et al. 2019) and with a multi-frequency analysis pipeline (Glauch et al in preparation), identified the
the following xx known blazars inside the uncertainty region of IC200615A or in the area immediately surrounding it,
which we propose as Swift ToO targets
