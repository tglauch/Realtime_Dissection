\begin{{abstract}}
{prelim}On MJD {date:.2f} the IceCube Neutrino Observatory  has reported the detection of a highly-energetic neutrino,
\textit{{{event}}}, with direction ra: {ra:.2f}$^\circ$, dec: {dec:.2f}$^\circ$ in equatorial and l: {l:.2f}$^\circ$, b:
{b:.2f}$^\circ$ in galactic coordinates. Due to the high-energy and the track-like signature the event has a good
pointing and is likely of astrophysical origin. With the goal of identifing
the corresponding electromagnetic counterpart we report here on the muli-wavenlength dissection of the region around the event.
\end{{abstract}}

\section{{Identifying counterpart candidates}}
The search for possible counterparts is based on the VOU-Blazar Tool \cite{{voublazar}} and follows closely the pipeline
developed in \cite{{Padovani:2018acg}}.  VOU-Blazar compares 32 multi-wavelengths catalogs\footnote{{List of the 32 catalogs used in this
analysis: SDS82 , 3HSP , Fermi8YR ,1BIGB, MST9Y, FIRST, SUMSS, WGACAT, IPC2E, ZWCLUSTERS,
PSZ2, ABELL , SDSSWHL, CRATES, NVSS, SXPS, RASS, XMMSL, BMW , IPCSL, CHANDRA, MCXC,  5BZCat, SWXCS, PULSAR, F2PSR,
3FHL, 3FGL, 3XMM, MAXI, FermiMEV, AGILE}}
to find all positions in the vicinity of the alert event with a \textit{{blazar-like}} radio
to X-ray emission ratio. Each match is then checked against existing blazar catalogs to identify possible associations. \\

In order to search for gamma-ray anomalies in the region we use Fermi-LAT data around the event time and run three different analysis
pipelines. Firstly, TS and residual maps are generated to search for unknown gamma-ray emmitters, e.g. indication for
emission from the previously identfied \textit{{VOU-Sources}} without gamma-ray association. At the same time the
residual map gives information of the 
the goodness of fit using the 3FGL model. Subsequently SEDs and light curves are produced for each identified catalog
source. This allows as to search for specific features in flux and spectral shape around the neutrino arrival time. The
analyses are based on the latest version of the FSSC Tools v11r5p3 and the fermipy package
\cite{{fermipy}}. We use the the standart procedures as described in the Fermi-LAT Cicerone \cite{{fermi_ci}}. The
dataset for the analysis contains events with photon energy above {emin} GeV in a time window between {mjd1:.1f} and {mjd2:.1f}.

\subsection{{Quick summary: Catalog sources in the region}}
The following list gives a quick overview about the catalog blazars and flat-spectrum radio sources in the region. The
full output of VOU-Blazar is given below. Sources are sorted by their angular distance to the neutrino direction.

\subsection{{Full multi-wavelength study of the region}}
In this section we present the full multi-wavelength search for possible neutrino counterparts. Starting from 32
multi-wavenlength catalogs the VOU-Blazar Tool \cite{{voublazar}} uses the radio to x-ray emission ratio in order to search for
non-thermal counterparts candidates. In the following sources are sorted by their right ascension.
