\begin{{abstract}}
{prelim}On MJD {date} the IceCube Neutrino Observatory  has reported the detection of a highly-energetic neutrino, \textit{{{event}}}, with direction
ra: {ra:.2f}$^\circ$, dec: {dec:.2f}$^\circ$ (l: {l:.2f}$^\circ$, b: {b:.2f}$^\circ$) that has a good chance of being of astropysical origin. With the goal of identifing
the corresponding electromagnetic counterpart we report here on the muli-wavenlength dissection of the region around the event.
\end{{abstract}}

\section{{Identifying counterpart candidates}}
The search for possible counterparts is based on the VOU-Blazar Tool \cite{{voublazar}}. The tool compares existing
multi-wavelengths catalogs to find all positions in the region around the event that have a \textit{{blazar-like}} radio
to X-ray emission ratio. For each match existing gamma-ray catalogs are checked to identify possible counterparts. \\

The following gamma-ray analysis is based on the latest version of the FSSC Tools v11r5p3 and the fermipy package
\cite{{fermipy}}. The dataset contains photon energies above {emin} GeV and a time window between {mjd1:.1f} and {mjd2:.1f}

\subsection{{Quick summary: Catalog sources in the region}}
The following list gives a short overview about the most interesting catalog sources in the region. Check the following section for a more detailed analysis. The sources are sorted by their distance to the neutrino direction.

\subsection{{Full multi-wavelength study of the region}}
In this section the full multi-wavelength search for neutrino counterparts is presented. Despite catalog sources also candidate sources are listed based on the x-ray to radio emission. The sources are sorted by their right ascension.
